# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-RSA-algorithm
Cryptography is a process used for sending information in secret way. Goal of this process is to provide protection for information but in different way. The encrypted image is used as input for network for furtherimplementation.RSA encrypt image with 1 bit rotation. In 1 bit rotation only 1 bit is shifted and at decrypt side shifted bit are reversed. But to make it more secure we are going toper form 2 bit rotation due to which it is more secure as compared to existing algorithm. After applying the 2 bit rotation we perform the permutation of that image that will give us encrypted image.
